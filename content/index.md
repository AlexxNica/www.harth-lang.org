# The Harth Programming Language

## Why The Name "Harth"?

Harth is a contraction of **Har**vey **Th**ompson. That way people can be sure who the original author was.

The name also evokes the idea of a "Hearth", a warm and cosy often industrial sized fire-place
in the home or blacksmith's; here food is cooked or new tools are forged.

## Yet Another Programming Language?

I've used many programming languages in my 30 years of
programming. Each of these languages have some good and not-so good
parts. I've often wondered what would happen if you took all the
reasonable bits of each and made a language from that. [Harth] is that
experiment.

Hopefully it will not turn into a Jack-of-all-Trades (Master of None), nor a
confusing Swiss-Army-Knife language (the sort you keep around if you
can't find your professional toolbox).

## Languages I Borrowed Ideas From

In building [Harth] I'm borrowing some of the "good" ideas from
various existing languages. Each of these languages are well worth
learning and using in their own right.

I acknowldge and are very grateful for the massive amount of work put
in by all the clever people behind these projects.

Languages I've actually used:

* [C]
* [C++]
* [C#]
* [Java]
* [Lisp]
* [Python]

And from languages I've read about but not really used:

* [Ceylon]
* [Erlang]
* [Julia]
* [Kotlin]
* [Ruby]
* [Rust]
* [Swift]

And probably several other languages I've read about.
